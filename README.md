# etch-a-sketch
another project from The Odin project

The issue in this exercise was to create a grid of divs, which will react on mouseover movement. If you hover over the element, it will darken 10% black to make it completely black. You can reset grid from default 16x16 (WxH by screen size) to prompt another resolution of a new grid.

You can type max resolution of 100 x 100.
